The Question-of-the-week discord bot gives you a new AI generated question every week by using python.

Create a discord bot with the documentation on

Sign up with openai to access their API and get a key
https://openai.com/api/

Install the requirements with

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Inside of bot.py you can change the question and the date of the message

Change the .env.example file to .env and insert you Discord token, the Discord channel ID you want to use and the OpenAI API key

And finally run 
```
python bot.py
```
